    <h1>The Oxen and The Wheels</h1>
    <h2>From Aesop's Fables</h2>
    <p>A pair of <span style="color: #3644DB;">Oxen</span> were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road. They had to use
    <br>all their strength to pull the wagon, but they did not complain. 
    
    <p>The <span style="color: #3644DB;">Wheels</span> of the wagon were of different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared
    <br>with that of the Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, pulling with all their 
    <br>might to draw the wagon through the deep mud, had their ears filled with loud complaining of the Wheels.
    <br>And this, you may well know, made their work so much the harder to endure. 
    </p>

    <p><span style="color: #3644DB;">"Silence!"</span> the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. <span style="color: #3644DB">"What have you Wheel to complain about so loudly?
    <br>We are drawing all the weight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides."</span>
    </p>

    <p style="color: #3644DB; background-color: #8F7827; font-size: 24px; padding: 10px;">Moral of the lesson: They complain most who suffer least.</p>
